Based on that we can conclude that prices in RJ-MG are significantly different at the 95 percent confidence level.


***Main goal of the project is to come to know if our average price differs based on the state or not if we cross this information with some indicators such as purchasing power we can draw some conclusions for commercial policies and also performance***.


***A part from Anova + Tukey (Parametric) I have also added Kruskal-wallis test and Dunn Test once this should be considered for non parametric option aiming the same conclusion that we can get from anova***.

Thank you üôè
